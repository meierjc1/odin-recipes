        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 (4 ounce) patties ground beef</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the Gravy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups beef stock</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>2 drops sesame oil, or to taste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ketchup</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons white sugar (Optional)</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced green onions, white and light green parts only</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 cups hot cooked white rice</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Season patties with salt, pepper, and cayenne.</li>
            <li>Whisk beef stock, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, sesame oil, ketchup, sugar,
                and cornstarch together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patty in the hot skillet until a browned crust
                forms on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Flip; toss in green onions and cook the other side until both beef
                and onions are browned, 4 to 5 minutes more. Remove patty and most of the green onions to a plate.</li>
            <li>Pour beef stock mixture into the skillet. Stir, scraping up browned bits from the bottom, until
                thickened, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and reserve gravy until needed.</li>
            <li>Melt remaining butter in another skillet over medium heat.
                Add eggs to the skillet and fry side-by-side until whites are set and yolks are still runny.</li>
            <li>Divide rice between 2 serving bowls. Place patties over the rice, spoon gravy on top,
                and add the fried eggs.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Chef's Notes:</h4>
        <p>I do recommend using a thinner patty, around 4 ounces, which will make this easier to eat,
            as well as provide a better beef-to-rice-to-gravy ratio. I had a pound of meat and decided to make
            two portions, but in hindsight I should have saved half for something else.
            The beef patty is standard, but SPAM(R) is also used, as is roast pork, and even seafood.</p>
